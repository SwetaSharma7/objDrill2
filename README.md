Problem Statement:

We have a dataset containing information about various users, including their age, designation, interests, qualification, and nationality. The goal is to perform several queries on this dataset to extract specific information about the users.
Solution:

The solution is provided in a set of JavaScript files, each addressing a specific query:

    Q1.js: Find all users who are interested in playing video games.
    Q2.js: Find all users staying in Germany.
    Q3.js: Sort users based on their seniority level for Designation and age.
    Q4.js: Find all users with a master's degree.
    Q5.js: Group users based on the programming language mentioned in their designation.

The user data is stored in a separate file, users.js, to maintain modularity. Each query file can be executed independently to obtain the desired results.

To run a specific query, execute the corresponding JavaScript file using a Node.js environment:

bash

node Q1.js

Repeat the process for other query files to explore different aspects of the user dataset. The results will be logged to the console.
